    "Finally, there are many states accounted for the in dataset. If we convert this column to a categorical variable, and create dummies, it will create a rather sparse matrix (many 0s in our dataset) becuase there will be 49 dummy variables.

Ridge does not perform feature selection, so it may still retain uninformative features.\n",

When features are highly correlated, LASSO may arbitrarily select one feature over another, potentially losing valuable information.\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the balance between two types of errors that affect model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: the error that arises from assumptions made by the model to simplify the problem. High bias implies the model is too simple and may not capture the underlying patterns of the data well, resulting in underfitting. A high-bias model might miss meaningful relationships in the data, leading to poor predictions (underfitting). \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: the error that arises from the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance implies the model is too complex, capturing noise as if it were signal, leading to overfitting. A high-variance model might perform well on the training data but poorly on new data (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and variance represent a tradeoff, where if you try to lower the level of bias by making a model more complex, you will also increase its variance due to this added complexity. This tradeoff needs to be navigated in order for a model to perform well out of sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health-related data like diabetes rates are often influenced by complex interactions between multiple features, such as demographics, socioeconomic factors, and health behaviors. If the model is overly simplified, it might fail to capture these interactions. Conversely, an overly complex model may pick up on noise in the data (random variations), which won’t generalize to other counties."

    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too closely, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise and outliers. This often results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data and fails to generalize. Overfitting typically happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of data, has too many parameters, or is trained for too many iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is problematic because the primary goal of machine learning is to create models that generalize well to new data. A model that overfits lacks generalization capacities and it is therefore unreliable for real-world applications. A model which memorizes the training data may miss underlying trends, making predictions that are overly specific to the training data’s peculiarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can address overfitting by increasing bias. We can do this by tuning parameters that force a model to become more simple. For example, we can increase the amount of regularization used in a Lasso or Ridge Regression model by tuning their `alpha` parameter, or we can force a tree-based model to have higher bias by tuning and decreasing the maximum depth of the trees."

    "Before analyzing and running the dataframe through different models, I already had some knowledge about diabetes rates across the country, based on general assumptions: older populations tend to have slightly higher rates of diabetes; African Americans generally experience slightly higher rates of diabetes compared to people of European descent; some counties in the Northeast and West are likely to be more physically active due to lower car dependence and greater use of public transit and/or bicycles; and finally, the East Coast, on average, has a slightly lower concentration of fast food restaurants and food deserts compared to the South and Midwest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on conclusions from prior research, I wanted to see if the data would support these assumptions. Some obvious recommendations include prioritizing the pilot program in counties with the highest obesity and physical inactivity rates. The two variables, obesity_number and physical_inactivity_number, are highly correlated with diabetes_number across the three models I used. More specifically, I recommend piloting the program in counties with the highest rates of physical inactivity and obesity in the Southeast and South regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on specific counties in the South region, Mississippi counties occupy a majority of the top spots, indicating that resources could be effectively concentrated here for impactful interventions. Counties like Okfuskee (Oklahoma), Sunflower (Mississippi), and Jefferson (Mississippi) might benefit significantly from targeted health programs to address high obesity rates and improve physical activity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Southeast region, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, and Alabama have counties with high obesity and physical inactivity rates, with Georgia appearing most frequently. Counties such as Candler County (Georgia) and King And Queen County (Virginia) could benefit from programs addressing both obesity and physical inactivity. Johnson County, Georgia, with a physical inactivity rate over 30%, may require additional resources or initiatives specifically aimed at increasing physical activity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "While making recommendations, I calculated (see cells below) the racial breakdown in the South and Southeast regions. Since Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Georgia have multiple counties in the top 10 list above, I focused on these states. I further examined race data due to the racial disparities in diet-related illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes. Although the White population is the majority in both regions—and within the states of Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Georgia—there are also significant racial minorities within these states and in specific counties like Okfuskee and Johnson. For example, approximately 56% of Mississippi’s population is White, but over 70% of Sunflower County identifies as African American. Similarly, while Oklahoma’s population is 73% White, 13% of Okfuskee County’s population identifies as American Indian and Alaska Native—a significant proportion, especially compared to the national average. These demographic considerations should be factored in when piloting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special attention should also be given to the age and gender breakdown, as all models show higher rates of diabetes among females aged 65 and over, and among both males and females between the ages of 65 and 74.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impressive to analyze population-level data like this, and as a researcher with an interest in the field of \"food as medicine,\" I would be very interested in deploying machine learning to target interventions for diet-related illnesses, particularly for pilot programs. My biggest concern, however, is that the dataset clearly skews toward the white population. In a real-world setting, I would prioritize reducing racial and income disparities in model deployment."
